<h1>How to Find Lightning Deals on Amazon Fast (Even the Hidden Ones)</h1>

<h2>‚ö° What Are Amazon Lightning Deals?</h2>
<p>Lightning Deals are time-limited offers that disappear quickly, usually within a few hours. They often include top-rated products at steep discounts‚Äîbut only if you catch them in time.
