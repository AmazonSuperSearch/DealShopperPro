  <h1>Amazon Filter by Seller? Here’s the Tool That Actually Works</h1>

  <p>Have you been Googling <strong>“Amazon filter by seller”</strong> or trying to figure out how to <strong>see only items sold by Amazon</strong>? You’re not alone. Thousands of shoppers are frustrated that Amazon removed the “Sold by Amazon.com” filter. But the good news is — <a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com/" target="_blank">DealShopperPro.com</a> brings that filter back and more.</p>

  <h2>Why Can’t You Filter Amazon by Seller Anymore?</h2>
  <p>Amazon quietly removed the ability to filter search results by seller, especially the option to show only products sold and shipped by Amazon. This makes it difficult to avoid unreliable third-party sellers, counterfeits, or dropshippers. For those looking to <strong>exclude 3rd party sellers on Amazon</strong>, it’s become almost impossible — unless you know where to look.</p>

  <h2>How to Filter Amazon Results by Seller — the Better Way</h2>
  <p>That’s where <a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com/how-it-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deal Shopper Pro</a> comes in. This free tool allows you to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Search Amazon by Seller</strong> — such as Prime-only or Amazon’s own listings</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Filter Amazon results by brand, discount, coupons, shipping options</strong></li>
    <li>✅ Combine filters like in-stock items, star ratings, eco options, and more</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can finally create Amazon searches like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Show me only items <strong>sold by Amazon</strong>, that are Prime-eligible, discounted 20%, with 4★+ ratings and active coupons.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Try it here: <a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com/" target="_blank">DealShopperPro.com — Advanced Amazon Filters</a></p>

  <h2>Example: Filter Amazon for Official Brands Only</h2>
  <p>Let’s say you’re shopping for Apple accessories and want to make sure you’re buying only from Amazon or Apple, not shady third-party sellers. Using Deal Shopper Pro, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📝 Enter keywords: “Apple charger USB-C”</li>
    <li>🎯 Filter by brand: “Apple”</li>
    <li>🚚 Check “Prime only” and “Sold by Amazon” filters</li>
    <li>⭐ Filter for 4-star reviews and above</li>
    <li>💸 Add discount or coupon options if desired</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Amazon itself doesn’t offer this level of filtering anymore — but Deal Shopper Pro does.</p>

  <h2>People Are Searching for This — and Getting Frustrated</h2>
  <p>According to Google Trends and Reddit discussions, searches like <strong>“amazon filter by seller,” “how to search Amazon by seller,”</strong> and <strong>“sold by Amazon filter missing”</strong> have surged in popularity. That’s because shoppers want control and confidence in what they’re buying — especially with so many listings from unknown sellers.</p>
