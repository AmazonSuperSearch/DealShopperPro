    <h1 class="mb-3">I Lost Everything—Then Built a Free Tool to Help Millions Shop Smarter on Amazon</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">By Duane Romualdo | Creator of DealShopperPro.com</p>

    <p>There are moments in life when everything changes. For me, that moment came more than once.</p>
    <p>At 15, I lost my father to cancer.</p>
    <p>At 19, I was in a coma — and woke up completely paralyzed on the left side of my body.<br>
    It wasn’t permanent, but the road back was brutal. I was determined to recover. I spent every day pushing myself — from wheelchair to walker, from walker to walking again. I forced my body to fight, even when it didn’t want to.<br>
    Today, I’m proud to say I regained a lot. But the truth is, I’ll never be 100%. The left side of my body is still weaker, slower, less coordinated. And that’s okay. I kept going anyway.</p>

    <p>Each time, I rebuilt. But after Hurricane Ian hit Fort Myers Beach, FL, I lost everything I owned — and even a few good friends who didn’t survive the storm. Starting over wasn’t just emotional — it was physical, financial, and digital. I relocated to Pennsylvania in 2023 with no resources, no home, and no clear path forward.</p>

    <p>But I did have one thing: a relentless determination to make something work online.</p>
    <p>I became obsessed with AI — not just the hype, but the real potential. I didn’t have a team. I didn’t have a budget. But I had an idea and ChatGPT.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Problem That Sparked Everything</h2>
    <p>Amazon is where we all shop — but have you ever tried to find the exact product you need?<br>
    The filters barely work. You can’t sort by Prime-only + coupon + price range + rating + color + discount. You can’t even easily find Lightning Deals or brand-specific sales without digging through pages of junk.</p>

    <p>I kept thinking: <em>Why is it so hard to search Amazon properly?</em></p>
    <p>So I built the solution.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">What I Created — With No Money and No Code Team</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com" target="_blank">DealShopperPro.com</a> is the tool I wish existed. It's a free Amazon deal-finder that lets anyone filter products with precision:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Only want Prime-eligible items? Easy.</li>
      <li>✅ Looking for Lightning Deals under $25 with free shipping? One click.</li>
      <li>✅ Need a specific brand, size, rating, or coupon combo? Done.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The site uses Amazon’s public affiliate structure, meaning I earn a small commission if someone buys through it — but it costs users nothing. No logins. No popups. No gimmicks. Just powerful search.</p>
    <p>And it works — even on mobile.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Built With AI. Run By One Person. Helping Thousands.</h2>
    <p>This wasn’t built in Silicon Valley. I didn’t raise VC money.<br>
    I sat down, opened ChatGPT, and asked questions like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “How do I create a search URL for Amazon’s affiliate program?”<br>
      “How do I make an accordion-style UI with JavaScript filters?”<br>
      “How do I structure this for SEO and mobile usability?”
    </blockquote>
    <p>And together, we built it.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why I’m Sharing This Now</h2>
    <p>Because I know I’m not the only one who has started from nothing.<br>
    I know what it’s like to be overlooked. To feel invisible. To have talent and ideas, but no platform.</p>

    <p>And I believe stories like mine — real, raw, human — deserve to be heard.</p>
    <p>Yes, I created a tool that helps people save money. But I also created a symbol of what’s possible with no budget, no safety net, and no quit in you.</p>

    <p>If you’re a journalist, creator, or someone who believes in second chances — I’d love to talk. I built something real. I just need help getting it seen.</p>
