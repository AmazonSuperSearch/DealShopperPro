    <h1>🛠️ Amazon Filters Not Working? Here's the Better Way to Search</h1>

    <p>If you’ve ever typed something like “Amazon filters not working” into Google — right before launching your mouse across the room — you’re in good company.</p>

    <p>It’s 2025, and somehow filtering Amazon search results is still a nightmare. You check a box for Prime-only and get non-Prime items. You sort by lowest price… and it shows you products from 2007 that ship next March. You add a brand filter — and Amazon says, “Nah.”</p>

    <h2>🤯 Why Amazon Filters Fail (Even in 2025)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsored products override filters.</li>
      <li>Brand filters are sketchy at best.</li>
      <li>Sorting by price or rating doesn’t always reflect your filter settings.</li>
      <li>Filters don’t combine cleanly — so asking for “Prime-only + coupon + 4★ + $25–$50” just… breaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 There’s a Better Way: <a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com">DealShopperPro.com</a></h2>
    <p>Instead of playing Amazon filter roulette, try this: <a href="https://www.dealshopperpro.com">DealShopperPro.com</a> — a <strong>free tool</strong> that lets you stack powerful Amazon search filters with total control.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>✅ Prime-only</li>
      <li>✅ Coupon-clippable</li>
      <li>✅ Minimum rating</li>
      <li>✅ Exact brand</li>
      <li>✅ Discount %</li>
      <li>✅ Free shipping</li>
      <li>✅ In-stock only</li>
      <li>✅ Price range</li>
      <li>✅ Eco-friendly</li>
      <li>✅ Gift-eligible</li>
      <li>✅ Lightning Deals</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🤖 How It Works (And Why It’s Actually Fun)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Type what you're looking for — or paste an ASIN, UPC, or ISBN</li>
      <li>Set a price range that works for you</li>
      <li>Choose discount %, sort order, rating</li>
      <li>Filter by specific brands or keywords</li>
      <li>Add extras like Prime-only, Lightning Deals, coupons, etc.</li>
      <li>Click “View Filtered Results” — and see what Amazon should have shown you all along</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🧪 Ridiculous Example Amazon Would Never Let You Do</h2>

    <h2>🧵 Real Complaints from the Internet</h2>

    <blockquote>“I get the opposite of what I asked for. Filtering by price gives me $400 items when I asked for under $25.” — Google review</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“When I filter by Prime-only, half the results aren’t Prime. I give up.” — us, every week.</blockquote>
